In order to push or read data from the user's digi.me, we will need an user access token to their digi.me.
Once we have this, we can read up to date data of the services the user has onboarded to their digi.me.

User access tokens are obtained once a user successfully goes through a [authorization process](../fundamentals/authorize.html).

Separate user access tokens are required for each contract, so it is possible to have multiple for one user if you require to read and push data.

## Access Token Expiry

The access token will eventually expire. When you first created it, a timestamp in which it will expire will be returned. The SDK will attempt to refresh it automatically when you use it next. If a refresh is needed, it will return the new access token to you.

If the refresh is unsuccessful, you'll need to go through the authorization process again with the user.

Note that methods for reading data will also try to do auto refresh, so please add logic for keep this latest tokek that is returned back from SDK.
